## Tech


The provided code includes the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). Here's a breakdown of the technologies used in the code:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is used for structuring the web page and defining its elements. It provides the basic structure and content of the page.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to add styles and formatting to the HTML elements. It controls the visual presentation of the web page, including layout, colors, fonts, and more.

JavaScript (JS): JS is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. In the code, JavaScript is used for handling events, manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), and adding functionality to the forms.

The code includes HTML tags to define the structure and elements of the page, CSS styles for styling the elements and creating the layout, and JavaScript functions for handling form submissions, displaying retrieved data, and adding interactivity to the page.

Overall, the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows for the creation of interactive and visually appealing web forms.
